Project Description
Brief overview of the project:

A machine learning project that classifies text data into predefined categories using natural language processing and supervised learning techniques.

Features
Mention what the classifier does:

Preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, etc.)

Feature extraction (TF-IDF, Bag of Words, etc.)

Model training (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM)

Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

Prediction on new inputs
